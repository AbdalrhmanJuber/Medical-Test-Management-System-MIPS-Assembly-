# Medical-Test-Management-System-MIPS-Assembly-
## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project is a Medical Test Management System implemented in MIPS Assembly. The system efficiently stores, manages, and retrieves medical test data for individual patients. It provides a text-based menu to interact with the medical records, including adding, updating, searching, and deleting tests.


## 🚀 Features
**Add New Medical Test**: Store a new test while validating the input.
**Search by Patient ID**:
- Retrieve all patient tests.
- Retrieve abnormal test results.
- Retrieve tests within a specific period.
**Identify Abnormal Test Results**: List all patients with test results outside the normal range.
**Calculate Average Test Values**: Compute and display average test results.
**Update Existing Test Result**: Modify stored test data.
**Delete a Test**: Remove a specific test record.
**Error Handling & Data Validation**:
  - Handle invalid file names.
  - Detect missing patient records.
  - Ensure correct data formats for input.
